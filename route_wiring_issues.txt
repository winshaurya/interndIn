-- Route ↔ Controller Wiring & Middleware Order Issues

**JobRoutes.js**
- POST /post-job: validate -> auth -> role -> controller (GOOD)
- GET /get-my-jobs: auth -> role -> controller (no validate, ok for GET)
- GET /get-job-by-id/:id: auth -> role -> controller (no validate, ok)
- PUT /update-job/:id: auth -> role -> validate -> controller (BAD: validate should be first)
- DELETE /delete-job/:id: auth -> role -> controller (no validate, ok)
- GET /get-all-jobs-student: no middleware (public?)
- GET /get-job-by-id-student/:id: no middleware (public?)
- GET /view-applicants/:jobId: auth -> role -> controller (ok)

Fix: Move validate to front for PUT.

**profileRoutes.js**
- All routes have auth via router.use(authenticate)
- No role middleware
- No validation middleware
- Controllers handle role checks internally

Issues: Missing validation, missing role checks (should have role based on endpoint)

**authRoutes.js**
- POST /register: no middleware (ok)
- POST /login: no middleware (ok)
- GET /profile: auth -> controller (ok)

Issues: No validation for register/login

**Other routes**: Need to check similarly.

Common issues:
- Inconsistent middleware order: not always validation first
- Many routes lack validationMiddleware
- Some routes lack roleMiddleware
- Public routes ok without auth/role

Actions:
- Add validation schemas for profiles, auth, etc.
- Reorder middleware to validation -> auth -> role -> controller
- Add roleMiddleware where needed
